# Filesystem destroyer
Creates a folder with a very annoying amount of random files.

You can test your PC's performance by creating random .txt files over and over again.
Don't forget the "out/" directory if you don't want to kill your file system.

## Update
Added another script that allows you to fill you drive with files of random or given sizes.
